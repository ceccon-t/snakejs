# SnakeJS

## Description

An implementation of the classic Snake game as a webpage.

## How to play online

The most recent version of the game can always be played at [https://snakejs-247n.onrender.com/](https://snakejs-247n.onrender.com/).

## How to run locally

Make sure you have npm installed.

As an initial one-time step, clone the repository to a folder in your computer, navigate to this folder with the terminal and run `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies the project uses.

Afterwards, just run `npm start` on a terminal while in the project's main folder. The application will be accessible by opening up your browser and going to `http://localhost:8080/`.

Alternatively, you can just start any web server of your chooing while using the `snakejs` folder as the root and the application will be available by navigating to the server's configured host and port. Since the code uses only vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, no build step is required.
